# Stabilization of Polyacrylonitrile Carbon Fiber Precursors

This repository contains MATLAB code for simulating the stabilization process of polyacrylonitrile (PAN) carbon fiber precursors. The code and calculations are based on the research conducted by Michael G. Dunham, Ph.D., at Clemson University in 1990.

## Usage

To run the code, follow these steps:

1. Run `gui_fig.m` to launch the graphical user interface (GUI).
2. In the GUI, choose the desired simulation by clicking on either the "Multi Filament" or "Single Filament" button.
3. Enter the values for the required parameters in the designated text boxes.
4. Several predefined cases have been prepared for each simulation. By selecting one of the cases using its radio button, values will be automatically assigned to all the required parameters based on the chosen case. You can use these predefined values directly to run the simulation, or modify any of them as required.
   - Note: If you prefer to start with a clean slate, you can choose the "New case" radio button to clear all the values and enter them manually.
5. After setting the parameters, click the "Run" button to execute the code and perform the simulation.

## Simulation Types

### Multi Filament

The "Multi Filament" simulation focuses on the stabilization process of multiple polyacrylonitrile carbon fiber precursors simultaneously. The simulation allows for studying the behavior and properties of multiple filaments during stabilization.

### Single Filament

The "Single Filament" simulation concentrates on the stabilization process of a single polyacrylonitrile carbon fiber precursor. This simulation provides a detailed analysis of the stabilization process for a single filament.
